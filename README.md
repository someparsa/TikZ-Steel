# TikZ-Steel
A TikZ-LaTeX package to draw steel cross-sections

## Aim
It is a very tough work to prepare high-quality figures for papers and reports. The aim of the package is to make such time-consuming procedure, easier for the engineers and academics in the field of cold-formed and hot-rolled steel, structural engineering.

## Tools
This package is developed over the very useful and powerfull TikZ package. Therefor, all the great features of that library is accessible when using TikZ-Steel. Apparently you will need LaTeX and TikZ installed on your system in order to be able to use this package.

## Installation
Clone this or download the latest version of this repository.

`$ git clone https://github.com/someparsa/TikZ-Steel.git`

Put the `.sty` file in the directory where you save your LaTeX file. Then import the package like any other standard packages in LaTeX system.

`\usepackage{tikzSteel}`

This package is still not added to the CTAN.

## To-do list

### done
- [x] Main cold-formed steel (CFS) cross-sections

### under development

- [ ] Export the shapes to CAD DXF format

### undone
- [ ] CFS cross-sections with stiffeners
- [ ] More CFS cross-sections to be added
- [ ] 3D drawing of the profiles
- [ ] Dimensions and annotations
